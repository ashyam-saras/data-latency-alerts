To complete the setup, please set the following Airflow Variables in the Composer environment:

1. DATA_LATENCY_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL: https://us-central1-$PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/data-latency-alerts
2. DATA_LATENCY_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID: Your Slack channel ID
3. DATA_LATENCY_SLACK_API_TOKEN: Your Slack API token
4. DATA_LATENCY_PROJECT_NAME: $PROJECT_ID

You can set these variables using the Airflow UI or gcloud commands:

gcloud composer environments run $ENVIRONMENT_NAME --location $LOCATION variables set -- DATA_LATENCY_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL "https://us-central1-$PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/data-latency-alerts"
gcloud composer environments run $ENVIRONMENT_NAME --location $LOCATION variables set -- DATA_LATENCY_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
gcloud composer environments run $ENVIRONMENT_NAME --location $LOCATION variables set -- DATA_LATENCY_SLACK_API_TOKEN "YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN"
gcloud composer environments run $ENVIRONMENT_NAME --location $LOCATION variables set -- DATA_LATENCY_PROJECT_NAME "$PROJECT_ID"
